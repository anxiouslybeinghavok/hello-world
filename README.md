github guided walkthrough

Uhm, I'm not sure I will remember all of this, so some notes: 

1) The Master is the one you would ship
2) The branches are the newer versions of the Master, that you are messing with and don't want to screw up what is actually working in the Master
3) You can then save the branch as the Maser (I think?) and have a new solid and shiny version of whatever the hell you're wanting to do.
